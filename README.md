##Background

Course project for Getting and Cleaning data. 


##Explanation

Provided a set of training data and testing data, aggregate them together and extract specific tidy data (mean and std for all variables broken down by subject and activity).

Data must be loaded independently, then cleaned, and merged together.

The script run_analysis.R follows the procedure specified below:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The finished product is a result.txt.

##Codebook

The codebook is located in codebook.md. It explains the variables used.
